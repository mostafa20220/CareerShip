## üìå About The Project

**Careership** is an interactive, RESTful API-driven educational platform designed to provide Computer Science students with crucial hands-on experience. The platform allows students to select real-world projects, build them following best practices, and receive instant, automated feedback on their code.

The core mission is to solve a common problem for students and junior developers: having a strong theoretical foundation but lacking a portfolio of practical, industry-standard projects. Careership provides a structured environment to build that portfolio, learn modern development workflows, and gain confidence before entering the job market.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **ü§ñ Automated Testing Engine:** A robust system using **Docker** and **Celery** to securely run student code submissions against predefined test cases and provide immediate results.
* **üß† AI-Powered Project Wizard:** Integration with the **Google Gemini Pro** model allows students to generate new, custom project specifications and receive contextual AI feedback on their code.
* **ü§ù Team Management:** Students can form teams, send invitations, and collaborate on larger projects, simulating a real-world development environment.
* **üìú Certificate Generation:** Automatically issues verifiable PDF certificates to students who successfully complete projects, providing a tangible reward for their efforts.
* **üîê Secure Authentication:** Features a hybrid authentication system with traditional token-based **JWT** and social login via **Google & GitHub OAuth 2.0**.
* **üöÄ Cloud Deployment:** Fully deployed on **AWS**, leveraging EC2 for the backend, RDS for the database, and Amplify for frontend CI/CD.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose
* Python 3.9+
* Node.js and npm (for frontend)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repositories**
    * Create a main project directory and clone both repos inside it.
        ```sh
        mkdir CareershipProject
        cd CareershipProject
        git clone https://github.com/mostafa20220/CareerShip.git
        git clone https://github.com/mostafa20220/careership-frontend.git
        ```

2.  **Backend Setup**
    * Navigate to the backend directory: `cd CareerShip`
    * Create your environment file by copying the example. Then, open the new `.env` file and add your secret keys.
        ```sh
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    * **Install Python Dependencies (Local Virtual Environment)**
        *(Note: The following steps are for a local setup. The recommended Docker setup handles this automatically.)*
        
        1. Create a virtual environment:
           ```sh
           python -m venv .venv
           ```
        2. Activate the virtual environment:
           * On Windows:
             ```sh
             .venv\Scripts\activate
             ```
           * On macOS/Linux:
             ```sh
             source .venv/bin/activate
             ```
        3. Install the required packages:
           ```sh
           pip install -r requirements.txt
           ```
    * **Run with Docker (Recommended)**
        * Build and run the Docker containers:
          ```sh
          docker-compose up --build -d
          ```
        * Run database migrations:
          ```sh
          docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
          ```

3.  **Frontend Setup**
    * Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd ../careership-frontend`
    * Create your local environment file by copying the example. Then, open the new `.env.local` file and add your API URL and client IDs.
        ```sh
        cp .env.example .env.local
        ```
    * Install NPM packages:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    * Start the development server:
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8001` and the frontend at `http://localhost:5173`.
